# C Simple Projects
This repository contains simple projects written in C language. The projects are written in C language and compiled using CMake build system.

## Projects
- **TaskMaster**: A task manager that can be used to manage tasks. The tasks are stored in a file and can be added, removed, and listed.
- **NonogramSolver**: A nonogram solver that can be used to solve nonogram puzzles. The puzzles are stored in a file and can be solved using the solver.

## Concepts
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Data structures and Algorithms
- CMake build system
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Pruning methods

## Requirements
- CMake
- C compiler (gcc, clang, etc.)

## Build
To build the projects, run the following commands:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage
To use the projects, run the following commands:
```bash
./TaskMaster
./NonogramSolver
```
